# ICIBICI

[Icibici](https://icibici.github.io/smartphone-bci-hardware) is a hardware / software platform born with the intention of Developing an EEG under Â£20.

This is the **Software Repository** for the smartphone BCI Project Android App

This repository is part of a Hardware - Software system:

* [icibici](https://github.com/icibici/smartphone-bci)
* [icibici-hardware](https://github.com/icibici/smartphone-bci-hardware)


## The Android app

This is the Android app for the [icibici project](https://icibici.github.io/site/).
It allows to visualise the data read from the [Icibici hardware ](https://github.com/icibici/smartphone-bci-hardware/) and it is under heavy development.

There are three tabs (change from one to another by swiping) 

EEG frequency analysis from the bipolar electrode:

Power of the alpha band over time

There should be two big peaks in the sanity check (electrodes not yet attached to head), one around 0 and one around 50Hz (or 60Hz depending on your electrical mains)

TODO:

 - Use a C/C++ fft implementation.
 - Move the driver functionality to a separate project so it can be easily used in other apps.
 - The code is a bad state due to different rushes and time constrains, it needs a clean up. 
 - The alpha viewer should baseline to the self band not to the relative values
